Please write a query to find 50 published posts of a custom post type `book` that are in a taxonomy of `genre` with the term `fiction` and have a meta key of `rating` with a value above 3 ordered by the numeric meta value descending. Please note your query will not neccassarily be run but will be assessed for correctness of key names and structure.

If you wanted to cache some data on the server with an optional expiration time, how might you go about this? Is there a built-in Wordpress function that could be used?

If you wanted to persist some global site data how might you go about this? Where would you store it?

You've registered a new post type, added a post and visited the page on the frontend but sadly it 404s. What would be the first thing to check / try to resolve this?

Assuming we're not concerned with pagination which will perform faster, WP_Query or get_posts?

There is a broken page on a live site and it needs a quick diagnosis. Is there a way we could see the errors (perhaps output in a file) without having them show to users on the frontend of the site? Is there a combination of Wordpress specific constants we could set to achieve this and if so where would we set them?

If we wanted to let our logged in users set and later update their mood where could we record this data? Are there built-in Wordpress functions to help with this?

Can you please tell us at least one thing that can be done with a .htaccess file?

The ACF function get_field allows me to retrieve a value for the given field key, either for the current post or optionally a post I specify. What are the three most likely data types I would expect back from this function?
